# Random Walk RPI Project
A project for the RPI summer school to implement a random walk routine for studying virii.


## Dependencies:
* bash >= 5.x for example


## Summary

We will be creating several random walks of thousand steps, running each walk at least a thousand times. Our current goal (subject to change) is to graph information from these walks and understand what components of the walks match a Gaussian curve. The initial code is already completed, we shall be working on optimizing the code in python to run faster. Currently, the code can only do around 400 walks of 400 steps. After optimizing it in python, we plan on translating it to c++ and optimizing it as needed. Once this is completed, we can work on adding components to change the effects of the walks. Things we could add are self-avoiding walks or 3d walks that move on the surface of a sphere.

These random walks are part of a larger research project on the viral invasion of the cell body. More specifically, how extracellular material like vimentin, can aid or hinder a virus particle in entering a cell. Other applications of the random walks include the study of nuclear blebing (when the cell nucleus deforms resulting in a lump/bubble).
